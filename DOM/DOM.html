        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML 
        or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. 
        The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node 
        contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, 
        style or content of a document.

    <h2>Standards</h2>
    <p1>
        The W3C DOM Working Group published its final recommendation and subsequently disbanded in 2004. 
        Development efforts migrated to the WHATWG, which continues to maintain a living standard.
        In 2009, the Web Applications group reorganized DOM activities at the W3C.
        In 2013, due to a lack of progress and the impending release of HTML5, the DOM Level 4 specification was 
        reassigned to the HTML Working Group to expedite its completion.
        Meanwhile, in 2015, the Web Applications group was disbanded and DOM stewardship passed to the Web 
        Platform group. Beginning with the publication of DOM Level 4 in 2015, the W3C creates new 
        recommendations based on snapshots of the WHATWG standard.
    </p1>
    <li>DOM Level 1 provided a complete model for an entire HTML or XML document, including the means to change any portion of the document.</li>
    <li>DOM Level 2 was published in late 2000. It introduced the getElementById function as well as an event model and support for XML namespaces and CSS.</li>
    <li>DOM Level 3, published in April 2004, added support for XPath and keyboard event handling, as well as an interface for serializing documents as XML.</li>
    <li>DOM Level 4 was published in 2015. It is a snapshot of the WHATWG living standard</li>
