        Day 3
    </h2>
    <p>
        I found a sliding door. Finally, I can get something new from this! I went in, and found a metro system. Really
        funny guys. But I actually saw living humans this time! I talked for a bit, and some people gave me information
        about what levels to go to, what groups to join, what stuff to stock if you weren't going to join a group for
        now, tons and tons of stuff. When I went on the actual train, I kept waiting. Tons of people got off at certain
        spots, and it was only me for a bit of time. I decided to exit, and I went into the level known as "The Hub."
        This level, you can teleport to tons of different levels, plus the ones you already been too. I already unlocked
        Level 0, and The Metro from being there, but also get access to Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and from what I got
        told Level 4/Level -1 by a chance, and Level 25 and some sort of a cryptic worded level. Most of the above,
        being 0 to 3, 25 and The Metro were unlocked, but Level 4 with that chance one was achieved by no clipping. I
        decided to go back to The Metro to rest, and figure where I should go next.
